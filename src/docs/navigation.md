title: Navigation
---

The main navigation is managed by a webc component in `src/_includes/components/custom-nav.webc` and implemented by `src/_includes/components/custom-nav.njk`. You can switch the drawer for mobile navigation on and off with the attribute `drawer="true"`.

Edit your navigation items in `src/_data/navigation.js`.

In the off state the navigation defaults on small displays to small pills that wrap. This does not require any additional JavaScript.
